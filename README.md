# Toxicity reloaded

This is a fork of  [Toxicity reloaded][1] which has been tweaked to use a json output of [phpmetrics][2]

## Usage

* Generate a metrics file with using [phpmetrics][2] by running:<br>
`phpmetrics --report-json=metrics-report.json   path-to-codebase-src/`
* Open **toxicity.html**
* Load **metrics-report.json** generated by phpmetrics
